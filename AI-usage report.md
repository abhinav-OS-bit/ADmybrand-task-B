  - Animation keyframes (gradient shift, pulse effects, star fade-out)

- **Manual coding (Approx. 40%)**:
  - Integrating and adapting components into Next.js structure
  - Fine-tuning scroll behavior and cursor alignment
  - Fixing bugs with autoplay testimonials and section IDs
  - Customizing theme variables and dark mode-only design

- **Customization**:
  - Converted AI-suggested styles into projectâ€™s theme colors
  - Adjusted animation timings and offsets for smoothness
  - Optimized for deployment (Vercel) and performance
